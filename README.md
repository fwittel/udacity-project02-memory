# Memory Game

Memory Game is a small HTML application that mimics classic card-based memory games. 

## Dependencies
The game requires two small online resources:
* Google Fonts: [https://fonts.googleapis.com](https://fonts.googleapis.com)
* Fontawesome: [https://kit.fontawesome.com](https://kit.fontawesome.com)


## Usage
The HTML can be run locally or on a server. Playing the game follows basic matching game logics: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game))
